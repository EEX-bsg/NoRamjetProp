## Description
### How this mod disables ramjet prop.  
The ramjet acts on the propeller because the vertical direction of the velocity sensing surface and the vector of the force on the propeller are misaligned.  
※For more information on "velocity sensing surface", see the Ramjet description page below.  
[JP-wiki](https://w.atwiki.jp/besiegejpwiki/pages/91.html)  
  
This mod makes the propeller force perpendicular to the velocity sensing surface.  
This allows the propeller to work as it appears and no ramjet is generated.
